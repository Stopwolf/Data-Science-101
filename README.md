# Data Science 101
This repository represents all materials shown and used during <i>S2S</i> event held in Belgrade at Faculty of Organizational Sciences.<br>
This workshop introduces participants to the world of data and presents foundations needed for further development in this industry. Topics covered in this repository and workshop are:
<ol>
  <li><a href='#python'>Intro to Python</a></li>
  <li><a href='#pandas'>Meet Pandas</a></li>
  <li>Visualizations</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Advanced Practices</li>
  <li>Ensemble Algorithms</li>
  <li>Clustering</li>
</ol><br>
<h2 id='python'> Intro to Python </h2>
The first lecture in the series is learning Python. There are a lot of arguments whether you should pick R or Python, but in my opinion, Python is more versatile and can do much more by itself. Another great thing about Python is that it has amazingly large community which develops new libraries almost every day!<br>
R shouldn't be neglected though. It's still used in the industry, but you should know that it's capabilities are only statistics based. So if you need to perform a certain and specific statistical task, maybe R is the way to go.<br>
I should emphasize that this lecture is absolutely introductory. It doesn't cover a big part of Python as a language, such as creating classes, object-oriented programming and more advanced practices. It covers only the strict basics needed for this workshop. It is recommened that the participants of the workshop learn the rest on their own.<br>

<h2 id='pandas'> Meet Pandas </h2>
In this lecture, participants will learn how to use most-widely used library for loading the dataset and performing initial analysis and preprocessing. This is arguably the most important lecture in the whole workshop because participants will use these skills the most when getting a job in data science sometime in the future (yes, when. Not if.. I'm confident they'll achieve their dreams if they work hard enough after the workshop :)).
